pytextutils is the beginning of a small collection of simple text
utilities in Python.

It was thrown together as a fun learning project for the author.

Since there can be some politics around releasing code to the public
domain, I've placed it under the simplified 2-clause BSD license.

USAGE NOTES:

The shebang line at the top of the script files refers to python3 and a
hard-coded path for env. This may need to be changed depending on your
system configuration.
